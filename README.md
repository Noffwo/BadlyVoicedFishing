# BadlyVociedFishing

A mod for WEBFISHING that replaces most of the game's SFX with my voice.
(i skipped some so loading this mod doesn't immediately make you go insane)

## Installation

the mod hasn't been made to be installed yet, just getting the github repo up! :3

## Building (keeping this here for myself dw about it)

To build the project, you need to set the `GDWeavePath` environment variable to your game install's GDWeave directory (e.g. `G:\games\steam\steamapps\common\WEBFISHING\GDWeave`). This can also be done in Rider with `File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Toolset and Build | MSBuild global properties` or with a .user file in Visual Studio.
